	"body": "<p>Thank you for your station's purchase of our flagship Swoopie, XL size! These machines are leading class in pest removal. All Swoopies come with a Class 4 Drone-AI chip, similar to that found in standard construction drones. Pre-built laws on standard-issue Swoopies are: 1: Maintain station cleanliness. 2: Avoid interfering with crew duties.</p><br><p>While it may seem at first like they struggle to clean large areas, or those pesky corners; have no fear! Thanks to the crew handles on their chins, simply borrow their head, point it at whatever you need cleaned up, and open the beak, they'll succ-vacc whatever filth they might have missed in their normal patrol patterns. This, combined with their lower-level intelligence means they're not a rival to your station's janitorial staff like many more intelligent Cyborgs and Robots, but instead a useful tool and companion to your staff! If they suck too much (or too little) simply 'Disarm'(TM) your Swoopie! Using the built-in switch, you can control suck strength to maximize clean, and minimize recovery.</p><br><p>If your Swoopie cleans up something it shouldn't, don't panic! You have two options: Either utilize the built-in ejection lever, located at the front of the chest, or smack it with a newspaper. Much like many station guard Oties, they're programmed to understand when they're being scolded, and eject anything inside of them.</p><br><p>If your Swoopie becomes damaged, speak to your local Robotics department for small-scale repairs, a Technical Manual is also included with your purchase. Should your Swoopie become destroyed, new models can be ordered from your local Cargo department.</p><br><p>We thank you once again for your purchase of our top of the line cleaning products, and look forward to future business with you! Please contact us at [Warning: External addresses not authorized on E-Shui Newsnet] for any comments, questions, concerns, or legal matters.</p>",

	"body": "<p>There is still no true explanation for the nearly sector-wide power failure that occurred two days ago, seeming sector-wide.</p><br><p>While the power failure only lasted a few seconds, half a minute for the slowest devices to reboot, it caused an intense amount of disruption across the sector, and plenty of worry from security and administration. However, no known technology is capable of producing such a massive EMP, and scientists insist that such an EMP would have a travel time, and more damage towards a point of origin, rather than simultaneous failure, logged at exactly 25680520:0817 ESST. (E-Shui Standard Time.)</p><br><p>However, many have noticed a seeming shift in stellar locations, with astronomers saying 'It's as if the whole galaxy shifted 6 degrees to the left', while everything is still visually the same, equipment pointed directly at stars seems to have shifted to the side.</p><br><p>Field reporter Lux remarked 'Things feel different. Not bad or good; just different.' While some believe it to be connected to Muriki's second moon, which held the award for 'most haunted location in the galaxy' until it was destroyed, haunted ever since the transport ship 'Honk-a-lala' crashed into it, killing all 1472 crewmembers on board the 17 man ship.</p><br><p>--</p><br><p>In other news, additional wildlife has been reported on Muriki's Outpost-21, officials believe they may be stowaways from a ship that crashed approximately three miles south of Outpost-21, carrying cargo and livestock for a nearby system. Many of these creatures are likely to perish in the enzymatic rains of the planet, and will not likely be a concern to station crew, though security teams would like to remind crew to remain cautious when exploring outside, or in the caverns of the mountain, as some creatures may have found shelter from the acids in the comparatively tame atmosphere of the caves.</p>",

	"body": "<p>Recently, E-Shui officials have made the final confirmations on the decision to move Robotics to the Engineering department. Local construction teams have approved blueprints to relocate the mechanical and repair wards to Engineering, with talks ongoing about the circuitry lab to follow.</p><br><p>The decision follows several weeks of debate, with opponents saying 'The decision to move robotics will heavily hinder their production without access to the research department's tools,' and 'the decision is only being made to band-aid the problem of overhiring research and underfunding engineering.' While supports argue the move will assist in cross-department cooperation and makes more logical sense, saying 'AI repair and electronics are already the job of the engineer, why are drone fabricator repairs done in engineering, but the drones and synths in research? The people are already trained, and know the material' as well as arguing for material security in lieu of multiple break-ins.</p><br><p>E-Shui also reminds that any members of the research team currently assigned to robotics can choose to repurpose in research, or can be transferred to the engineering team, with construction and engine training to follow at a later date. E-Shui will provide training on engine operations and other engineering training not already covered in the robotics electrical safety courses, provided by Chief Engineer Aiektaaknell, or other engineering crew, at request.</p><br><p>Local Research Director Trashfire could not be reached for comment.</p><br><p>Construction is likely to be made in the coming days, and local AI Tracer would like to remind research teams to not leave personal belongings in either construction sites, or they will be likely recycled into construction materials.</p>",

The massive drop in air pressure caused minor structural damage and widespread confusion and panic throughout the outpost.</p><br><p>However, the event was not supernatural caused, or even a 'worm-hole technology designed to suck out atmosphere from planets for syndicate usage' as some speculated, but instead a minor health issue in the terraformer, caused by a recent tesloose. Tissue had been electrified and jolted, causing a delayed reaction in the terraformer, that started to cause, for lack of better terms, hiccups.</p><br><p>In response to uneven respiration jolting the terraformer, it began a biological process similar to that of breathing in and holding your breath to reset the diaphragm, causing it to inhale at least half of the planet's atmosphere into its many, massive lungs. This also caused severe structural damage to the terraformer's shell which has since been repaired, and caused outpost-21 to be evacuated in fears of massive structural damage when the terraformer exhaled all this gas again, or worse, if it belched.</p>",

But the question of investors is 'is it working?' Local AI Tracer has compiled the data of every report. According to the data supplied; traps have killed approximately: 73 spiders, 17 chus, 110 Clowns, and countless mice and jils. Crew casualties estimate at 24. Structural damage has been largely relegated to support walls, rock walls, and plating. Damage to critical wires and air pipes has been minimal. Resulting in a stamp of approval from central command. The 'Passive Deterrance' policy is expected to roll out to outposts 20, 19, 18, and 14, in the coming weeks.</p><br><p>However, the traps have been met with a large amount of criticism, especially from new security teams; wondering why the station needs traps. Further, following seizmic activity resulting in sections of ground collapsing to the caves below, and a 4.2 earthquake that shook debris off the mountain, some are thinking the sudden surge of explosive traps is causing destabilization in the wet ground. E-Shui officials were quick to point out it's more likely to be the result of mass on-grounds mining.</p><br><p>---</p><br><p>In other news, Outpost-21 recently passed through an asteroid field that used to be the second moon. While much of the rock debris became the ring we all enjoy in the night sky, large sections were left behind in uneven orbits. Recently, much of that came raining back down in brilliant displays of color and fire. After structural damage to the station was repaired, survey drones reported a 'higher than usual' concentration of ore deposits on station grounds. Local mining teams could not be reached for comment.</p>",

However, it prompted theories of a 'redspace'; an as of yet unproven functional opposite.</p><br><p>However, recent anomalies on local Outpost-21 have been making waves in the wider reaches of space due to reports of a sort of 'hellish landscape'. Security footage recovered were often corrupted and crew that had returned reported being in a 'dream-like state'.</p><br><p>However, with so many correlating reports of a 'fleshy dimension filled with creatures and a twisted version of the station', psychologists have had little explanation other than rampant group psychosis formed nightmares. Local AI Tracer confirmed 'spacetime anomalies did not match records of typical wormholes found (...) Energy signatures, time dilation, latent spatial radiation, and crew cellular degradation varies from current records.' Local Research Director Trashfire had this to say: 'We cannot confirm, nor deny if this redspace exists or not(...) The most bizarre phenomena regarding this is our active communication with crewmembers in 'redspace' matching positions but not seeing them, watching as doors seemingly open on their own input but the redspaced crewmember opening it.'</p><br><p>Whether these portals head to Redspace, Hell, undiscovered areas of Bluespace, or are some other anomaly, is yet to be fully answered. Further questions are raised when wondering why these anomalies seem unique to Outposts 21, 20, and 18. But one thing is to be certain, if you find yourself in such an anomalous area. Stay calm, remain aware of your surroundings, and attempt to seek out a shimmering violet portal to get back to reality.</p>",
